As long I can remember, I have had a passion for giving life to interactive experiences and conveying the essence of an idea effectively through story telling. Enhance design by motion.</p>

        <h3>SkillsField</h3>
            <h4><span aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe605;"></span>Motion Design</h4>
            <p></p>
            <h4><span aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe600;"></span>Front-end development</h4>
            <p></p>
            <h4><span aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe606;"></span>Compositing</h4>
            <p>Depending on the source material, I'm pretty comfortable with the following techniques: keying, rotoscoping and 2D/3D match moving.</p>
                    <p>I often aimed interactive video and movie synchronization with personal data, such as facebook profile, uploaded pictures... So I have a good knowledge of the different ways to export, integrate videos (and tracking data when needed),
                        then finally drive them by programming.</p>
                    <p>I used to deal with quite bad quality footages and spend hours and days in retouching films frame by frame.
                        <br/>To avoid tedious work and poor results I can advice and request good practices before the film shoot. I'm also open to try each new technique wich can improve the workflow and the quality of the post-production process.</p>
            <h4><span aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe604;"></span>Research and development</h4>
            <p>Some projects require pushing the technology into uncharted territory. I can explore this, help to define the technical limits and if agreed upon, integrate the results of experimentation to the main production.</p>
                    <p>Also, it just so happens that I developed my own tools to simplify the more tedious steps we had to deal with on particular projects.</p>
                    <p>For instance, on I Kill A Friend and I Kill A Friend 2, [links] I developed a tool to check the position of the 3d mesh in space, the synch movement with the movie, the quality of the rotoscoping, and setup of the 3D lighting.
                        <br/>Likewise, on 208 Greetings [Links], I built an app to record the animation display of the characters which are dynamically generated.</p>
            <h4><span aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe601;"></span><span aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#xe603;"></span>Editing / 3D Modeling</h4>
            <p>I used to be in charge of the almost entire production process on some projects. It's why I had the occasion to work on video editing and 3D modeling.</p>
                    <p>For sure this fields are not my speciality, but they cross or approach my main skills such as motion design.
                        <br/>It also give me a pretty good ability in collaborating with video editors and 3D artists / modelers. I can easily fit in a team which is pretty well film-production-oriented.</p>
