Turbodrive
==========
Turbodrive is the portfolio of Silvère Maréchal (Interactive Motion Designer). It works as an interactive showreel.
Formerly developed in ActionScript (Flash), this HTML5/CSS/Javascript version is built to run on desktop and tablets. The main goal is to be close as possible of the Flash version, with interactive video and 3D transitions. It's also the occasion to take the advantage of the touchevent for the navigation.

Basically, the JS part is based on libraries and modules such as : Require.js (AMD API for javascript modules), Signals.js (events), GSAP (tweening), JQuery, Crossroads and Hasher, and an old, customzied version of Sprite3D.js

Although the project is currently in production, the beta version is available online for tests.

Soon, I'd like to introduce the workflow I've created for managing CSS3D transition from Adobe After Effect.
